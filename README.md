# Group-7-Term-3-Code

Welcome to our code!

Our robotics code has three paths, controlled by a button. Every loop the kill switch is first checked, so in order to start the robot the user must press this button. Afterwards a counter on a separate button is used to decide whether line following, wall following, or the lava pit code should be activated. Within each of these paths, the necessary sensors collect data and apply the appropriate input to the motors.
